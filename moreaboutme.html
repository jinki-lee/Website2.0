  <div class="chat-bubble">
  <div class="container" id="text">
    <p>I was born and raised in Calgary, Alberta.</p>
    <p>I am Korean! Unfortunately, I am not fluent at it...</p>
    <br>
    <p>I am working towards getting my <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/certifications/exams/az-900/" target="_blank">AZ-900</a>, Microsoft Azure Fundamentals Certification.</p>
    <p>I am planning on getting my <a href="https://grow.google/certificates/ux-design/#?modal_active=none" target="_blank">Google UX Design</a> Certificate.</p>
    <p>I am interested in getting a <a href="https://www.pmi.org/certifications/project-management-pmp" target="_blank">Project Management Professional</a> (PMP).</p>

    
    <br>
    <h4>Strengths:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><span style="font-size: x-large; color: #388087;">Creative:</span> I consider myself a creative individual who can bring about change in the highly competitive business environment by presenting new concepts and ideas, and assisting the company in discovering their unique position in an overcrowded market.</li>
      <li><span style="font-size: x-large; color: #388087;">Curious:</span> I believe it's fantastic for others to gain insight into what people are contemplating these days and to potentially think in a different manner. That's why I strive to maintain an open-minded approach and to acquire new knowledge daily.</li>
      <li><span style="font-size: x-large; color: #388087;">Solving Problems:</span> I have always enjoyed solving problems because it gives me a highly satisfying feeling. Whenever someone asks me a question and I don't know the answer, I make a deliberate attempt to find the solution as quickly as possible.</li>
      <li><span style="font-size: x-large; color: #388087;">Empathetic:</span> In UX design, it is crucial to address the user's problems by setting aside personal opinions and embracing what is observed and heard. Empathy in design involves comprehending not just the user's needs but also their limitations and the broader context of their situation. I have honed this trait through personal development and having it instilled in me by my parents. It has greatly simplified my work. </li>
      <li><span style="font-size: x-large; color: #388087;">Organized:</span> Since my childhood, I have demonstrated a strong inclination towards organization and tidiness. This is evident in my affinity for maintaining a well-ordered and tidy workspace, my habit of planning out my day ahead of time, and my tendency to look ahead and plan for the future. These habits are a testament to my innate sense of order and my desire to create a structured environment.</li>
    </ul>

    <br>

    <h4>Areas to Improve:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><span style="font-size: x-large; color: #388087;">Public Speaking:</span> Despite the lack of significant opportunities to practice speaking in front of large audiences, I am determined to enhance my abilities in this area over time. To support this goal, I regularly engage in reading various books with the intention of broadening my vocabulary and enhancing my overall communication skills.</li>
      <li><span style="font-size: x-large; color: #388087;">Self-criticism:</span> My foremost deficiency is that I tend to be excessively self-critical and frequently experience a sense of inadequacy, perceiving that I am not delivering my full potential or letting down my colleagues. This leads me to continuously strive for improvement and results in an unrelenting self-evaluation, which at times can hinder my progress and confidence.</li>
      <li><span style="font-size: x-large; color: #388087;">Competitive:</span> I am highly competitive, which is reflected in my involvement in various leisure activities. However, I understand that it's not always necessary to strive for perfection or to outperform others, and that it's acceptable to fall short sometimes. It is important to acknowledge that competitiveness should not be a hindrance in enjoying one's hobbies, and that it's okay to not be the best at everything.</li>
      <li><span style="font-size: x-large; color: #388087;">Patience:</span> I believe that my impatience is a positive attribute, as it drives me to avoid missing deadlines and targets. Through my impatience, I have learned to hone my negotiation skills and find innovative ways to obtain information. I have become more proactive in my approach, frequently asking my colleagues for their estimated time of completion, which has fostered stronger team relationships within the office and has resulted in quicker response times.</li>
