    <h4>Too Long; Read Anyways Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯ </h4>
    <div class="container" id="text">

        <p>
            <span id="capital">J</span>ust recently, I graduated from the University of Calgary (April 2022) with a Bachelor of Arts majoring in Economics and a minor in Business Management and Society. 
            I developed a strong foundation in advanced microeconomics, macroeconomics, econometrics, global trading systems, monetary theory, strategic business law and marketing. 
            During my time I was able to quickly learn new applications such as Minitab, and Stata, and further develop my Microsoft Office skills. 
            Using these applications allowed me to collect and present the data I had researched throughout the numerous cost-benefit analysis, research papers, and professional presentations.
            I also took other interesting option courses such as <i>ART 251 - Media Arts: Practice & Theory</i>. This course introduced me to Adobe Creative Suite, specifically Adobe Photoshop.
            At this time, I was not sure exactly when and how I would apply this skill to my career, but quite frankly, it has helped me tremendously...
        </p>
        
        <p>
            <span id="capital">I</span> am now a student at SAIT enrolled in the Information Technology program, majoring in Software Development (May 2022)   .
            I consider myself a tech-savvy individual but had no prior experience in software development.
            During my undergraduate studies at UCalgary, I contemplated my career path and wanted to pursue a field I was more passionate about.
            Rather than dropping out or switching out of my program, I decided to finish my Bachelor's degree and enroll at SAIT.
        </p>
    
        <p>
            <span id="capital">N</span>o doubt, this was the best decision I have made in my life as I am now exploring the beginning of my journey as a software developer.
            After my first year, I have been introduced: object oriented programming, website design, interface design, database design and programming. After barely scratching the surface of these courses, I am realizing there is so much to learn and the potential to do great things.
            I am not the brightest person, but I like to think that I am a very creative person. In my website design class, I was taught to use HTML / CSS / JavaScript, and BootStrap to create and style my own websites according to the rubric and requirements. In my interface design class,
            I was taught to use AdobeXD, another application in the Adobe Creative Suite, and was introduced to basic UX / UI principles. I found that many principles and fundamentals from my past experience with Adobe Photoshop had transitioned to AdobeXD, making this course fairly straight-foward and giving me the opportunity to explore areas beyond the scope of this course.
            I learned a lot from these instructors who were passionate about their career and the success for their students, and I also learned that I found a passion for creating products, engaging with users, and exploring UX / UI design.
        </p>

        <p>
            <span id="capital">K</span>icking off the new year (January 2023), I begin my first professional career as a software developer at ENMAX. My title was the "Digital Experience Co-Op Student" and I worked to maintain and develop <a href="https://www.enmax.com/home" target="_blank">ENMAX.com</a>, while also suggesting a new perspectives and applying my education to current and upcoming projects. 
        </p>

        <p>
            <span id="capital">I</span> don't necessarily believe in luck, but I do believe you can put yourself in lucky situtions.
            I went through years of school, taking a variety of courses, meeting new people, and ultimately - followinwg my passion. I am grateful for the people I have met throughout my
            career for sharing their ideas, supporting my decisions, allowing me to learn from them, and shaping the person I am today.
