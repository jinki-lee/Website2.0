    <div class="container" id="text">

        <p>
            <span id="capital">J</span>ust recently, I graduated from the University of Calgary in April 2022 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Economics, and a minor in Business Management and Society. During my studies, I acquired a strong foundation in advanced microeconomics, macroeconomics, econometrics, global trading systems, monetary theory, strategic business law, and marketing. 
            I was able to quickly learn and utilize applications such as Minitab and Stata, and further enhance my Microsoft Office skills. These tools enabled me to gather and present data from various cost-benefit analyses, research papers, and professional presentations. Additionally, I took an interesting elective course, ART 251 - Media Arts: Practice & Theory, where I was introduced to Adobe Creative Suite, specifically Adobe Photoshop. 
            At the time, I wasn't sure how I would apply this skill to my career, but it has proven to be extremely helpful.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            <span id="capital">I</span> am currently a student at SAIT, enrolled in the Information Technology program with a major in Software Development, expected to graduate in May 2022. 
            Despite being tech-savvy, I had no prior experience in software development. During my undergraduate studies at UCalgary, I considered my career path and realized that I was more passionate about another field. Rather than quitting or changing programs, I decided to complete my Bachelor's degree and enroll at SAIT.
        </p>
    
        <p>
            <span id="capital">N</span>o doubt, making the choice to pursue a career as a software developer was the best decision of my life. In my first year, I was introduced to various aspects of software development, including object-oriented programming, website design, interface design, database design, and programming. Although I've only just begun to delve into these topics, I have already realized the vast potential for growth and the endless possibilities for greatness.

            While I may not be the brightest individual, I consider myself to be a highly creative person. During my website design class, I learned how to use HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap to create and style my own websites, adhering to the provided rubric and requirements. In my interface design course, I was taught to use Adobe XD, a tool within the Adobe Creative Suite, and familiarized with basic UX/UI principles. Interestingly, I discovered that many of the principles and fundamental skills I acquired from my previous experience with Adobe Photoshop were transferable to Adobe XD, making this course relatively straightforward and allowing me to explore areas beyond the curriculum.
        </p>

        <p>
            <span id="capital">K</span>icking off the new year on January 2023, I embarked on my first professional career as a software developer at <a href="https://www.enmax.com/home" target="_blank">ENMAX.com</a>, My role was as the "Digital Experience Co-Op Student," where I was responsible for maintaining and developing the ENMAX.com website. I also brought new perspectives to the table and applied my education to current and future projects."
        </p>

        <p>
            <span id="capital">I</span> don't necessarily have faith in luck, however, I do hold the belief that one can create advantageous circumstances for themselves. Over the years, I have invested in my education by enrolling in a range of academic programs, encountering new individuals, and pursuing my passion. I am thankful for the individuals I have encountered throughout my professional journey, who have imparted their thoughts, backed my choices, taught me invaluable lessons, and molded me into the person I am today.
