          <br>
          <p>
            When I applied to ENMAX, I was lucky that Dave was the one who stumbled upon my application and saw my very first <a href="https://jinki-lee.github.io/blog/" target="_blanks">website.</a> I enjoyed spending the time and generating creative ideas to showcase my very first project
            as a software developer, and I am glad someone - like Dave - did as well. I accepted the job as a Digital Experience Developer, and one of my many tasks was to redesign and bring creativity for the current and upcoming digital projects.
          </p>
          <p>
            During the new hire orientation at ENMAX, new employees would go around introducing themselves and telling others a little bit about themselves as well. After sharing my introduction, Dave briefly put me on the spotlight to tell others. <i>"If you ever need to build a webstie/resume, or get creative ideas, get in touch with Jinki. Check out his website and make sure to click all the buttons!".</i>
            It was a very special moment for me, as I got to meet a lot of people after the meeting, and I later sent Dave a message to thank him for adding on a small comment to my introduction.
            He later told me about the importance about sharing knowledge, and how it's great for others to see what people are thinking of these days and how to maybe think differently.
          </p>
          <p>
            These words of encouragement resided with me and ultimately encouraged me to share my creativity with others and become more open minded.

              <br>
              <p>
                I attended my very first UX Visual Design Workshop at ENMAX after a couple of days of just starting. In this workshop, I was surrounded by many employees, team leads, VPs, Directors, and Executives from many different departments.
                The purpose of this workshop was to gather ideas, suggest new ideas, and take a look at ENMAX's current website / UX, and other websites / UX.
                If I am being honest, it was intimidating to be sitting in that room. I was just a Co-Op student, learning my role, and about the company itself. I noticed many of my team members sat quietly, listening to people debate, and observing the situation.
                I also sat quietly, but then I remembered Dave, along with many of my other team members, encouraged me to share my creativity and I reminded myself that my job here as a Digital Experience Co-Op Student is to bring in new ideas and creativity. I later shared my thoughts during that workshop.
              </p>
              <p>
                During my 1:1 meeting with Michelle, I asked her a personal question about her opinion on the workshops and operations/design/development for the website.
                She taught me a valuable life lesson for my early career about having the ability to observe people and the environment, process the situation, then speak freely in a respective way about my opinions. Afterward it is up to the other person to interpret that message.
                She encouraged me after that meeting to bring up this perspective from an outside view at the end of my Co-Op work term, and address the work dynamic I noticed very early into my new job.

        <p>I learned this one from my assigned buddy, Nathan, when I was a Digital Experience Student at ENMAX.
        He told me this on the first day on the job when exploring the old repository for the <a href="http://www.enmax.com" target="_blank">ENMAX.com</a> website before launch.
        Although it was not his assigned job, he remembered the Boy Scout Principle from his mentor, when he was first starting his professional career, to remind himself of this principle and to use best practices.

        <p class="lead">
            "Because frogs live at the bottom of a well, they look up from the bottom of the well and see the tiny sky like a lid. Every day so, so they assert that the sky is just the same size.
            <br>
            In that tiny world, frogs think of themselves as Lord, so they do not look at anyone. Never learned more about another environment, another world, for its very narrow vision, low level of understanding. But the frogs are so subjective, arrogant, claiming to be superior to everything else. That has become a habit, its bad habits.
            <br>
            The heavy rain only changes the living situation, not the cause of death of the frog, which is the cause of its pride.
            <br>
            The story advises us, whatever the circumstances, we must strive to learn to broaden our horizons and insights. We not only study at school, but also learn many things in life. School life is vast sea of knowledge and experience. We must overcome our limitations and constantly learn to get high education and vision."

        <p>I learned this one from my close family friend, Young So, when I was in the final year of my undergraduate studies at UCalgary.
            I was struggling and unsure of what I wanted to pursue in life, and seek for guidance and direction from someone who my family and I trusted and is very knowledgeable.
            He occasionally tells this story to students at other universities as a guest speaker, and personally told me this story when I was invited to tour <a href="https://www.flairpackaging.com/pages/home/about_flair/corporate_profile/FlairFlexiblePackaging-Calgary,Canada/1" target="_blank">Flair's Flexible Packaging</a> facility and see how operations worked on the floor and in the office.
            He emphasized that school and learning from others are incredibly important, especially as you begin to see how others think and also to think differently yourself. This is one of the many reasons why I decided to go to SAIT after graduating from UCalgary.

        <p class="lead">
            Everything we do, every interaction we have with each other, everything that we read, see or hear. Everything we feel or taste has a consequence. We make thousands of decisions a day, and each has a consequence. Now please donâ€™t misunderstand. When I say consequence, Iâ€™m not necessarily saying that the result is bad, but just that there is always a reaction. In the physical world, I believe that would be Newtonâ€™s First Law: Every action has a reaction.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
            What we say to each other, to our children, or to strangers we interact with may have a profound effect on their lives. Perhaps a kind word at a bad time will help someone make a change in their life. We read something which may open our eyes to other possibilities, or conversely, may remove the wonder of what is around us. We listen to music we like, and we smile. Could that be a consequence of the composerâ€™s action of putting something down on paper? We take our first breath, and as a result, we begin the process of death. We choose our partners, our careers, where we live, what we do for leisure. Each of those has a specific outcome.

          This is a lesson I learned as a kid which has evolved to a greater scale as I am now entering my early adulthood. I was first told about this when I was at a mall with my mom and passing by a booth.
          The booth was advertising a microfiber cloth and offered a "free cloth" if you signed up for a newsletter and watched the whole sales pitch. As a result, I was gifted a tiny sample and later bombarded with spam emails.
          As a kid, I was in disbelief - and that is when my mom said "there is nothing free in this world, you have to earn it".
        </p>
        <p>
          This stuck with me as I grew up, and I became more aware of the price we pay for monetary items, but also the price we pay for other people's time and relationships. It could be selfish at times, and something I need to work on but there are certain things we do for certain people simply because we know
          our worth to the other person and our willingness to offer our time and services to them. 
        </p>

          Having an educational background in behavioral economics to now software development it is interesting observing the social science behind prodcution, distribution, and consumption of goods and services, and the human psychology behind user experience and user interaction.

              This is one of the most recent phrases I heard from my dad. When all my peers were graduating, working a full-time jobs, and seemed like they had their life together, I felt that I was behind.
              I was contemplating and having deep thoughts about what I wanted to do in life and where I wanted to be in life. After meeting with my other peers to motivate and help me gain insight, I enrolled in SAIT to continue my education.
            </p>
            <p>
              Going straight back to school, to learn essentially a completely new language was difficult and I wanted to give up countless amounts of time. It was then, my dad had said (translated from Korean) 
              "Life is like a race, it's okay to take a break and continue running, while others are still running. Put all your effort in these two years for your Software Development Diploma, and the rest of your life will become easier".
            </p>
            <p>
              I took this to heart and I think I am on the right track... 
              I got my first professional corporate job at ENMAX, and I kept a promise to myself before applying that I will try my hardest and create value for the company that offered me a position. I love the work I do and dream of accomplishing more.
